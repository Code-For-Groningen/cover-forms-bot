Cover bot go brr.

## Intro
This bot is designed to be a simple way to get notifications whenever a user signs up for your Cover form. All you need to do to get the full functionality is to make sure you have access to the form on the Cover website and log in to your account (by passing credentials to the bot).

From there, you can decide whether to post notifications on Discord or on Whatsapp. The bot will automatically check for new signups every 5 minutes and send a message to the specified channel if there are any new signups. You can also specify a custom message to be sent along with the notification.

> [!Important]
> In order to not get banned on Whatsapp, a random quote will be sent every time the bot sends a message. I advise you not to change this behaviour.

## a poem to Meta and Whatsapp
```
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Meta is bad,
Whatsapp is too!

pywhatkit, what a delight!
open a browser, it's texting alright!
hijacking input - oh what a sight!
fuck you meta, for this stupid ass fight!

We should be getting API keys, control our bots, running all night!
But noooo, the "business accounts" are ones who are priviledged with that
